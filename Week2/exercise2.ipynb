    "In this exercise, we start by taking a closer look on some of the building blocks of machine learning and statistical modeling, namely **summary statistics** and **similarity measures**. While summary statistics capture key properties of data and help us understand and compare datasets, similarity metrics such as cosine similarity and norm-based distances are essential for certain machine learning methods, e.g. **$k$-nearest neighbors (kNN)** (This week) and **decision trees (DCTs)** (Week6). In the final parts of the exercise, we will do **supervised learning** with kNNs on real datasets.\n",

    "As you can hopefully see from the boxplot and summary statistics, the dataset has many observations that can be considered outliers and in order to carry out analyses later it is important to remove the corrupted observations, e.g. $10^{15}$ is clearly not a proper value for alcohol content! However, it is impossible to see the distribution of the data, because the axis is dominated by these extreme outliers. Say we expect volatide acidity (VA) to be around $0-2 \\textrm{g}/\\textrm{dm}^3$, density (D) to be close to $1 \\textrm{g}/\\textrm{cm}^3$, and alcohol percentage (AP) to be somewhere between $5-20\\% \\textrm{vol}$.
